# Hospital Service System – Readme

The Hospital Service System was developed as a WPI course project where I served as **Assistant Lead Engineer** for a team of nine developers. The goal was to build a cloud‑based web application that helps hospitals manage services, staff, and patient demand more effectively.

The application uses the **PERN stack** with a RESTful API architected through **Prisma ORM**. It implements secure user authentication, robust input validation, and **role‑based access control (RBAC)** so that different roles (e.g., admins, staff) see appropriate resources and controls.

The project was run using an agile workflow with sprint planning, daily stand‑ups, and peer code reviews. I coordinated Git workflows, resolved merge conflicts, and enforced code quality standards across the team.

**Key Technologies:** PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js (PERN), Prisma ORM, RBAC, Agile/Scrum.
