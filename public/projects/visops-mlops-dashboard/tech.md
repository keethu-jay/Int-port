# VisOps: MLOps Dashboard – Readme

VisOps is a high‑fidelity **UI/UX case study and technical prototype** for a centralized MLOps command center. It consolidates scattered CLI tools into a single interface that surfaces **real‑time training dynamics** (loss, accuracy, latent space) and experiment metadata.

The prototype simulates a **Human‑in‑the‑Loop** optimization flow, where interactive hyperparameter tuning can push model accuracy from **82.4% to 94.2%**. I also defined technical specifications for a secure cloud architecture using **S3 Presigned URLs** and **RBAC‑based data validation**.

VisOps proposes an automated **Run Summary** panel that converts raw metrics into stakeholder‑ready signals like compute cost, deployment readiness, and risk flags, making it easier for both engineers and PMs to reason about experiments.

**Key Technologies:** Figma (high‑fidelity prototyping), AWS/Cloud architecture specs, MLOps workflow design.
